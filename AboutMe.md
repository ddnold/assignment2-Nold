I was born in Austin, Texas on May 20th, 2000. I enjoy playing video games sometimes, I mostly just enjoy computers as a whole though. My dad has been in the military until very recently. As a result of this my childhood was spread thinly throughout the United States, at one point I even lived in Alaska. However by highschool I had moved in with my grandma and ended up settling down in Saint Joseph. I had heard a bunch about how NW had a great cs program, and of course I heard about the party scene, so I decided to take my college experience this way. And that is the jist of how I got to typing this today. 

In other words, this is **[me](DustinNoldPic.jpg)**
