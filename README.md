### Black Pony in Maryville   
The **Black Pony** brewery is on the square in **Maryville**. Therefore it is located around the courthouse, most the bars in town, and even some shops and cafes. The DMV is next door so its always a quick walk to get your license after eating there, or maybe you want a beer before your court date. Either way, the Black Pony brewing co. is nearby for easy access.
